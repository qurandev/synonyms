Mutaradifaat al Qur’an Translated files
==========================================
NOTE: All the translated content received from translator volunteers are split-up by Topic and each one is individually saved as a html file within its Topic letter folder.
To browse the different topics, you just need to open each folder and double click the html files.
Reviewers can make edits/corrections/changes to the HTML file (using their favorite html editor) and then send back the file. This file will be checked-in overwriting the previous article. Since we use a source version control system, all changes are tracked automatically and can be reverted back to any time.

Example: To see the first entry under Alif-mamdooah, open the "A" (alif) folder, and then double click A1.html. 
To see 22nd entry under Alif-maqsoorah, open "AA" folder and double click AA22.html.
