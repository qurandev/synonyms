In this way I finished the translation of the Quran once in my childhood. As I became older, I developed an enthusiasm for the close reading of the Quran. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">I became aware that different words of the Quran had been erroneously translated into Urdu using only one word, for example the words &#1582;&#1588;&#1610;&#1577; &#1582;&#1608;&#1601; &#1581;&#1584;&#1585; &#1608;&#1580;&#1604; &#1608;&#1580;&#1587; &#1578;&#1602;&#1608;&#1609; &#1585;&#1607;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;are all translated into &lsquo;to fear&rsquo;, which did not do justice to the subtle gradations of meaning. I had an inquisitive eagerness, to find out the underlying differences of these synonyms of the Quran, but found that most of the time, I was disappointed. Then I tried to turn to the scholars but was amazed that most of them had not looked into this matter, besides a few exceptions, such as Moulana Aziz Zubaidy, who was one of the first scholars I benefitted from. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The original problem was almost impossible to disentangle. Then I started looking closely at various books of transliterations. I found some books in which synonyms in Arabic had been collated; however the different underlying meanings were not distinguishable. However my first glimmer of hope came from Imam Raghib&rsquo;s book, Mufradaat. The Imam had indicated in some places, information relating to this matter, however, the Imam&rsquo;s focus was to discuss the individual subject matters of the Quran, not to show the differences in the underlying meanings of the lexis. Therefore most of the real problem was left unsolved, leaving my thirst for answers to this predicament, unquenched. Imam Raghib writes in the beginning of his preface: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Allah willing, if I live, I wish to offer such a comprehensive book in which the investigation of synonyms of the Quran and its subtle differences will be clearly described. With this, the wisdom of using different synonyms in the same topic of the Quran will be made clear, for example, in one place the word </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1602;&#1604;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;, another place </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1601;&#1572;&#1575;&#1583;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;, and in another place </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1589;&#1583;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;has been used. In the same formula/way we would show what the intricate subtle difference is to the ending of stories, such as in one place The Almighty says (16:79) </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1573;&#1616;&#1606;&#1617;&#1614; &#1601;&#1616;&#1610; &#1584;&#1614;&#1648;&#1604;&#1616;&#1603;&#1614; &#1604;&#1614;&#1570;&#1610;&#1614;&#1575;&#1578;&#1613; &#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1613; &#1610;&#1615;&#1572;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and in another place </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1613; &#1610;&#1614;&#1578;&#1614;&#1601;&#1614;&#1603;&#1617;&#1614;&#1585;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;,(30:21) another place (30:24) </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1617;&#1616;&#1602;&#1614;&#1608;&#1618;&#1605;&#1613; &#1610;&#1614;&#1593;&#1618;&#1602;&#1616;&#1604;&#1615;&#1608;&#1606;&#1614;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and in some places</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1602;&#1608;&#1605; &#1610;&#1601;&#1602;&#1607;&#1608;&#1606;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Surely, there must be a clear reason behind these subtle, yet quite obvious, differences? Therefore words used in the Quran such as </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1575;&#1608;&#1604;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1576;&#1589;&#1575;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1584;&#1610; &#1581;&#1580;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1575;&#1608;&#1604;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1607;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;led translators to sometimes select mere superficial meanings, thereby losing the essence of the message. They believe that they have done full justice to the Quran, by translating </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1604;&#1581;&#1605;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with the definition of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1603;&#1585; &#1604;&#1604;&#1607;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1575;&#1585;&#1610;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with the definition of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1604;&#1575; &#1588;&#1603;</span><span class="c3">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Only Allah knows if Imam Raghib completed this noble intention. Despite a lot of effort I was unable to locate any book which fulfilled this criteria. Even if I had done so, I am sure it would have only benefited Arabic Linguists or scholars. I was intent on producing a book which would focus on the subtle nuances of Arabic Linguistics, which would benefit both the scholar and the speaker of Urdu alike. So, therefore despite my ignorance I decided to write this book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Where there is a will there is a way: I slowly found books which made this hard task, easy. Within my focus I came across, another book called &lsquo;Fiqhul lughat&rsquo; by Abu Mansoor Abdul Malik ibn Mohammad Athaalaby in which I was able to find some basic indicators, for example he writes under the heading of &lsquo;</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1602;&#1608;&#1591;</span><span class="c3">&rsquo; five sentences </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1584;&#1585;&#1575;&#1606;&#1575;&#1576; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1593;&#1610;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1607;&#1608;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1606;&#1580;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1606;&#1602;&#1590; &#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1583;&#1575;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1585;&#1575;&#1604;&#1587;&#1602;&#1601;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1591;&#1575;&#1581; &#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1589;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;. However, looking at the five sentences you see that the first and last sentences have no connection with the Quran; and the second, third and fourth sentences you only learn that </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1607;&#1608;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is used for falling of the star, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1606;&#1602;&#1590;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for the falling of the wall, and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for the falling of the roof. This was frustrating as there was no depth, no indication of connections between the words or detail in which the underlying differences were made apparent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The third book which was beneficial in this matter was the book &lsquo;Alfurooqul lughawiyah&rsquo; </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1604;&#1601;&#1585;&#1608;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1608;&#1609;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;by Abu Hilal Askari. He describes the underlying differences of synonyms but only two at a time, sometimes the most would be three at a time, for example he will show the difference between </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1608;&#1601;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1588;&#1610;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1608;&#1601;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1585;&#1607;&#1576;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;separately , </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1588;&#1610;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1588;&#1601;&#1602;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;separately , and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1578;&#1582;&#1608;&#1610;&#1601;</span><span class="c3">and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1606;&#1584;&#1575;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;separately. But when we put them together and try to understand all the differences we experience great difficulties and it is quite disturbing. Therefore I could not benefit from it fully, in addition this book was limited and did not encompass all the root words of the Quran and its meanings. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c2">Basic meanings of root letters- old and modern inclination</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">The fourth book with which I took guidance from was the more modern text, Maqaayeesul-lughat &#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1610;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577; . The prominent speciality of this book is that it offers two or three base form root meanings/vocabulary depending on the situation, instead of just one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">Earlier scholars had a tendency of using just one basic pivotal meaning and then exploring the derivations, which resulted in making tenuous links. Although the reality is that some base forms when they are formed with the derived form of trilateral verb, the fundamental/root meaning disappears for example &#1603;&#1604;&#1605; (kalama) means to injure and &#1603;&#1604;&#1605; (kallama &ndash; with an emphasis on the second l) means to talk, ,&#1580;&#1575;&#1576; &#1610;&#1580;&#1608;&#1576; means to carve when &#1575;&#1580;&#1575;&#1576; means to answer and to accept, (azaba)&#1593;&#1584;&#1576; means the water to be sweet and pleasant and &#1593;&#1584;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(azzaba &ndash; when emphasis on the second z) means to give hard punishment,</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1602;&#1606;&#1593;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;means to be content, to be content with less and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1602;&#1606;&#1593;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;means to raise your head in order to see what is ahead, and not to look down . Basically in the Arabic language and in the Quraan there are many base forms which when used with derived form of the trilateral verb, have no relevance with the actual meaning, and this principle is directly related to the characteristic features of some of the derived forms, for which there are many examples.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imam Raghib was an early scholar therefore when he connects the fundamental meanings of derivations with the actual base form meanings, in the majority of cases, it is appropriate and the reader derives a good sense of understanding. However, when he starts to develop this further and goes on to explore further links which are quite tenuous, it does create conflict in the kind of the reader. For instance he translates </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1603;&#1604;&#1605;&#1578;&#1607;</span><span class="c3">(kalamtahoo), which means I injured him, then he connects, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1603;&#1604;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">and,</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;which means to talk; and states that this is used because injury caused by the tongue is noless severe than the physical injuries. Nevertheless, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1603;&#1604;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;clearly means to injure and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1603;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605; </span><span class="c3">clearly means to talk without reference to injury. Obviously all speech does not injure, the vast majority of times, it is pleasant and heals the wounds. In the same way, Imam Raghib takes </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1581;&#1585;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;which means to take the property of another, and connects it to the mihrab in a mosque, resulting in him stating that the mihrab is the place of war against the devil and personal desires or a place where the worshipper should leave all worldly affairs and thoughts (as though these worldly affairs and thoughts are taken away from him). However it seems, as though this function is just specific to the mihraab of the masjid, intimating that there is no further need or connection outside of this place (the mihraab). This explanation is a clear example of the weakness of the links made by Imam Raghib.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">On the contrary the author of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1610;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Maqaayeesul-lughat has a modern approach, he states two basic meanings of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1602;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(qalla)1, to be less 2, to be lofty, whereas Imam Raghib only states one basic meaning ,to be less and when the word</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1602;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;comes , like in the Quraan </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1581;&#1578;&#1610; &#1575;&#1584;&#1575; &#1575;&#1602;&#1604;&#1578; &#1587;&#1581;&#1575;&#1576;&#1575;&#1579;&#1602;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575; </span><span class="c3">(7:57) he indicates that this as, &ldquo;&rdquo;the winds elevates the heavy clouds thinking them as light and insignificant,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s why the word </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1602;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;has been used .&rdquo; Now the question arises, if we take the meaning of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1602;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as insignificant and light, then how do we get the meaning of elevation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">&#1605;&#1602;&#1575;&#1574;&#1610;&#1587; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1594;&#1577;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Maqaayeesul-lughat, is particularly excellent becauseit states 2,3 basic meanings of the base form in such a way that the underlying differences is automatically determined, for example for (</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576; &#1610; &#1606;</span><span class="c3">) he writes 3 basic meanings, 1,separation 2, distance 3, clarification. Automatically you can understand that </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1575;&#1606; </span><span class="c3">means something to be separated and distanced from another thing and to stand clear. Likewise the meaning of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1591;&#1604;&#1593;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;1, to become visible 2, to appear in front. The meaning of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1606;&#1592;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is 1,to inspect(to see something with your eyes) 2, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1578;&#1575;&#1605;&#1604; &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1574;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;waiting for something, to give a reprieve, allow time. The meaning of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1592;&#1604;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;1,to remove something from its original place to another by unlawful ways 2, darkness opposite of light and brightness. For this reason, it is quite obvious that there is no need to explore more tenuous links as the layers of meanings are made clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Anyhow all these texts are beneficial according to their topics and I found some parts of the text quite useful, whilst having to leave some aspects untouched. This is mainly because my focus was minute detail and more literary research, therefore I had to take advantage of many more dictionaries, translations and exegesis.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c3 c7">The references, sources and symbols</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the compilation of this book I have tried, to the best of my ability, that whenever a meaning is written, I state the reference of the dictionary used, except when the meaning of the word is so well known that a reference is not needed, for example </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1584;&#1607;&#1576;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;means to go and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582;&#1585;&#1580;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;means to come out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The abbreviations of the dictionaries which I have used, is given below in detail. I have tried not to present the translation of Quranic Aayaats myself , I have instead deferred to the translation of Moulana Fath Mohammad Jhaalandari Saheb because it is simple and idiomatic phrases are made clear. However, when the actual meaning was compromised due to urdu idiomatic phrases, then I have presented Moulana Shabbir Ahmed Uthmani&rsquo;s translation and have written in brackets (</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1593;&#1579;&#1605;&#1575;&#1606;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">). In some rare instances, I have selected from the translation of Moulana Moududi&rsquo;s translation Tafheemul-Quran. Although I used the above strategy in the main, there were some instances, when I had to make personal vocabulary selections in order to make the literal meaning clear. For the references of Quraan Ayaats, I employed the text of my Paternal Uncle Hafiz Abdul-Hayy &lsquo;s </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1605;&#1585;&#1575;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1602;&#1585;&#1575;&#1606;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;, in addition to this, I have, in some rare instances, also referenced his literal research.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Details of the references, sources and symbols:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9 c7">Reference Books and Dictionaries:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1. </span><span class="c3 c7">Mufraddat - </span><span class="c2">&#1605;&#1601;&#1585;&#1583;&#1575;&#1578;</span><span class="c3">by Imam Raghib - (Arabic to Urdu) =(</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1605;&#1601;</span><span class="c3">)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. </span><span class="c3 c7">Fiqhul lughat - </span><span class="c2">&#1601;&#1602;&#1607;

In the Arabic language if a verb is trilateral intransitive, when it is used in the derived trilateral form it becomes transitive. And if it is transitive in trilateral verb form, then it becomes double transitive or it holds specific qualities, except the derived form of the trilateral verb (infiaal )</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1606;&#1601;&#1593;&#1575;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as it always stays intransitive. In the Arabic language under the base form, all the intransitive and transitive meanings are given but in the Urdu language, different words for intransitive and transitive forms are employed, such as from </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;&#1662;&#1729;&#1740;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575; &#1662;&#1729;&#1587;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#1575; &#1705;&#1657;&#1606;&#1575; </span><span class="c3">to </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1705;&#1575;&#1657;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">. If I maintain the alphabetical order, then after </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1587;&#1604;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;it would be </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1604;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and then </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1740;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and the demand of explanation required of the Arabic basic form meaning, is that they are all are put together </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1662;&#1729;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;&#1662;&#1729;&#1740;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;put together, therefore to save time and repetition, I have chosen the latter. I have rejected the alphabetical order and put all the above mentioned words together. If the synonyms are more, then I have categorised them under two separate headings and if they are less then under just one heading such as </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1578;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575; &#1575;&#1578;&#1575;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Likewise is the matter of joint verbs (afaal murakkaba) In which the first word is a noun and the next if it&rsquo;s an intransitive verb then the murakkab becomes an intransitive and if it&rsquo;s a transitive it becomes a transitive. Such as </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1570;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583; &#1729;&#1608;&#1606;&#1575; &#1570;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583; &#1705;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for the abovementioned reason I have again rejected the alphabetical order and mentioned </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1570;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583; &#1729;&#1608;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">before </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1570;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583; &#1705;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. </span><span class="c3">The underlying differences of the Urdu headings: sometimes the urdu headings are so close in meaning it is hard to distinguish the underlying differences such as </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1729;&#1575;&#1711;&#1606;&#1575; &#1583;&#1608;&#1681;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">, </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1657;&#1729;&#1740;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575; &#1585;&#1705;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">, and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1657;&#1729;&#1740;&#1585;&#1606;&#1575; &#1570;&#1576;&#1575;&#1583;&#1729;&#1608;&#1606;&#1575;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;, in such place as well as clarification of the differences, I have indicated another heading which should be referred to.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. </span><span class="c3">The repetition of the Arabic base forms: This is clear that some Arabic words are so ambiguous in meaning that it is not possible to translate into one or two urdu words, a lot of explanation is needed such as </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1608; &#1593; &#1610;</span><span class="c3">means to put something in a bag and to tie the neck, now this word will come under the headings of, to be mean, to look after, to remember. Likewise </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1582; &#1584; &#1604;</span><span class="c3">means the abandoning of an intimate friend, of a friend at the time of need and to betray him, therefore this word will come under both headings, friend and to betray. Likewise the word </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1586;&#1608;&#1580;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;will come under many headings; husband, wife, companion, couple. Such words have been explained in one place and then referred to the other places. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. </span><span class="c3">The summary of synonyms: when there is only 2 or 3 synonyms to a word and is self-explanatory and the meaning of the underlying differences is made clear, then there is no need of a summary at the end. However, if there are more than 2 or 3 synonyms, then at the end of the heading, the summary of the words have been given. In a few places there were only 2 or 3 synonyms, but even after literal explanation, the underlying difference was not clear, therefore I have made it added a summary for further clarification. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Under some headings, there is a plethora of synonyms in the Quraan, for example:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nineteen words have been used for: to fall or to make someone fall; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fifteen words have been used for goods; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Thirteen have used for, to destroy; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Thirteen words for edge, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twelve for, to make something strong, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twenty one words for earth and others in this category</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twenty words, for noise and its type, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Thirteen words, for to become, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fifteen words for, to fear, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eleven words 11 for to run, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twelve words for, to walk, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twelve words for, to bend, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fourteen words for, a group , </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twelve words for, recompense,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten words have been used for, to be happy, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten words for, to collect, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten words for, to carry, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten words for, to give </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten words for, friend. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now you can understand how difficult it is to explain the underlying differences to all these synonyms and you can understand why there is a need of a summary at the end.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5. </span><span class="c3">The use of Antonyms: the use of the antonyms is useful in such a way that if you know the opposite meaning of one word then the meaning becomes immediately apparent, for this reason the linguistics usually mention the antonyms. Even in many places of the Quraan, antonyms have been mentioned. For example; (5:2)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">&#1608;&#1614;&#1578;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1576;&#1616;&#1585;&#1617;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1578;&#1617;&#1614;&#1602;&#1618;&#1608;&#1614;&#1609;&#1648; &#1750; &#1608;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1575; &#1578;&#1614;&#1593;&#1614;&#1575;&#1608;&#1614;&#1606;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575; &#1593;&#1614;&#1604;&#1614;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1573;&#1616;&#1579;&#1618;&#1605;&#1616; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1593;&#1615;&#1583;&#1618;&#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1616; &#1754;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. Now look in this ayat the word </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1579;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;has come contrary to </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1593;&#1583;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;opposite of</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1578;&#1602;&#1608;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">. So if someone knows the meaning of </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1585;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1578;&#1602;&#1608;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;then he can fully understand the connotations of the words </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1593;&#1583;&#1608;&#1575;&#1606;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1579;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and vice versa. Therefore besides mentioning the opposites in the main body of the text, I have added a chapter with the heading of Antonyms, in the appendix and I have further categorised this into three parts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">6. </span><span class="c3">The use of Quraanic Ayaats: I have only mentioned the specific Quraanic Ayaats, Ayaat or even part of an ayat according to the requirements for clarification purposes and to provide further examples. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">7. </span><span class="c3">Arabic Base Forms: To search for base forms of certain words is a real challenge. Even famous Linguists differ in their conclusions regarding the base forms of these particular words. In order to address this concern, I have placed these particular difficult words in brackets and also given a list of these words in the appendix, number five, under the title Some Difficult Base Forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">8. </span><span class="c3">Appendices: After mentioning the synonyms there were many words, such as Proper Nouns, which had no synonyms but required further explanation. Therefore to increase the benefit of this book, I have added a list of the following words in the appendix:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1. </span><span class="c3">All Proper Nouns under different headings (Prophets, Names of men and places and numbers)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. </span><span class="c3">Common nouns</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. </span><span class="c3">Antonyms</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">4. </span><span class="c3">Past or Present/Future Tense &ndash; when the harkat (dhamma/kasra/fatha) of the second Radical (letter :</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1593; </span><span class="c3">) changes, the meaning of the word also changes and this is made explicit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">5. </span><span class="c3">Miscellaneous</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">9. </span><span class="c3">Table of contents; two tables of contents have been made for this book. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A. </span><span class="c3">Urdu headings are in Alphabetical order. The main table of content contains all the synonyms used in the Quraan. In this table, there are 737 headings , and approximately 3100 Arabic base forms have been discussed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">B. </span><span class="c3">Arabic words and base forms used in the Quraan, have been stated in alphabetical order and its reference to the Urdu headings and appendices are indicated. However some words were left which had no synonyms nor were added in the appendices, eg.</span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1603;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">to cry or </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1575;&#1579;&#1605;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;(atthama) to involve someone in sin. I have added these type of words in this table and stated its meaning, with the ayat and surah number in brackets, e.g. </span><span class="c3 c4">&#1576;&#1603;&#1610;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to cry (12/16) , which means the numerator is the surah number, in which case here it means Surah Dahr, and the denominator is the ayat number , therefore this word is from the sixteenth ayah of Surah Dahr. It is important to highlight, when a base form is used in the Quraan under which derivative form it appears, all the forms have been enlisted in this table, therefore this table works as a comprehensive, albeit, abridged dictionary for the Quraan. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By close reading of this book, you will understand the depth of the Arabic language and therefore truly appreciate the eloquence and rhetoric of the Quraan. Rhetoric means to use precise and appropriate lexis, when you want to explain something and Eloquence is to explain fully and passionately, in brief but comprehensive lexis to the audience, and nothing is left ambiguous. After memorising the underlying differences to the synonyms you will begin to experience a deeper connection and understanding of Quraan. Only I, am aware of the tremendous effort and hard work which has been used in compiling and arranging this book. If it was not for the love of the heart and service of the Quraan , this could not have been achieved. Anyway this is the first book of its kind therefore there is a possibility of mistakes and errors. I request all the scholars and readers, if they come across any errors due to human nature and the limitations of my knowledge, please notify me, so that we can correct it in the future editions. Also, if you benefit from this book, then know that this from Allah&rsquo;s mercy and make duas for me, as this would be the true recompense of my endeavours. I would like to thank all those who helped me in anyway , I am very especially grateful to Hafiz Abdus Salaam Sahib Bhatwy and my son Hafiz Shafiqur Rahmaan who took the responsibility of proof reading of the Quraanic ayaats.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Wassalaam</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Abdur Rahmaan Kilaani </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
