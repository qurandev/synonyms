مِمَّن يَنقَلِبُ عَلَىٰ عَقِبَيْهِ ۚ وَإِن كَانَتْ لَكَبِيرَةً إِلَّا
عَلَى الَّذِينَ هَدَى اللَّهُ ۗ وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ
إِيمَانَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بِالنَّاسِ لَرَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ <br> <b>And thus we have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people</b>
and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the
qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who
would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels. And

to the people, Kind and Merciful. </font><br> <br> <br> <b>23.3 TAQWYM( تَقْوِيْم)</b>:
