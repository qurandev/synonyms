أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُوا عَنِ النَّجْوَىٰ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ
لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ وَيَتَنَاجَوْنَ بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ
وَمَعْصِيَتِ الرَّسُولِ وَإِذَا جَاءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ
بِهِ اللَّهُ<b> وَيَقُولُونَ فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلَا يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ</b> بِمَا نَقُولُ ۚ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا ۖ فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ <br>
Have you not considered those who were forbidden from private
conversation, then they return to that which they were forbidden and
converse among themselves about sin and aggression and disobedience to
the Messenger? And when they come to you, they greet you with that
[word] by which Allah does not greet you <b>and say among themselves, "Why does Allah not punish us</b> for what we say?" Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the destination. <br>
